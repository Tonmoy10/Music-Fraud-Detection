and has greatly impacted the evaluation of football performance \
[1]\[AHat]\.80\.93[5]. Several clubs are using the insights from the analysis \
of data of played games to improve on their performance in future matches. \
Football is a team sport, and the game has 2 teams, with players trying to \
score a goal.  To analyse a match, it is important to understand the dynamics \
of passes, the positioning and the movement of not only the individual \
players but also the whole team. The interest is to find the emergency of \
patterns in the collective dynamics of players that lead to goals. \
\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this master project, we will be analysing tracking data \
provided by the company Statsbomb [6], spanning several decades of tracking \
data for matches happening in several competitions around the world. The \
interest will be to construct a network representation of a team, based on \
the way footballers pass the ball. The players and their average position are \
the nodes of the network, and the amount of passes one player does to another \
in the duration of a game representing how well connected a player is with \
another will be the links of the network.  We hope to find network structures \
that enhances defensive performance, or those that favours wins. We will also \
do exploratory, and time-series based analysis of the matches, for example, \
understanding the properties of the time-series constructed from observing a \
player or a group of players moving in the pitch during the match. The \
analysis will firstly be focussed on an individual game (which contains \
already a very large amount of data), but could also be developed in more \
than 1 game for example when the interest is to compare the playing styles of \
the different schools of football happening in different continents and \
competitions. \\r\\n\\r\\n1. D. Bargiotas, An Analysis of FC Barcelona \

you may investigate techniques such as classification, clustering, or \
forecasting for time series, or explore novel representations like time \

applications include: analysing the motion and interaction of insects, \
characterising the complexity of physical systems (e.g. material fracture or \
water flow in porous media), or examining epidemiological data to better \
understand disease dynamics or mortality patterns.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe specific \

     PaneBox["\<\"Electroencephalography (EEG) is a method to record the \
spontaneous electrical activity of the brain, which shows a broad range of \
complex signal behaviours. To understand cortical function, the EEG signal is \
typically divided into bands by frequency (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and \
gamma), isolating the rhythmic activity. These bands are related to different \
physiological functions and produced by different neuronal circuits. However, \
the bands show different characteristics for different cortical locations and \
states of mind, such as during the sleep-wake cycle states, which includes \
the states of wakefulness, rapid-eye movement, and non-rapid-eye movement \
sleep. Since considerable motivation exists for the development of an \
adequate statistical model for spontaneous EEG activity, we propose to study \
the main EEG bands recorded during the sleep-wake state using methods from \
Statistics and Chaos theory. Those taking on this project will be provided \
with an EEG dataset, that they will need to filter into frequency bands \
(pre-processing), obtain the main statistical descriptors for these bands \
(feature extraction), create surrogate signals for statistical hypothesis \

engineering of biological elements to develop products that can improve human \
life and the application of machine learning is revolutionizing the field.\\r\
\\n\\r\\nInspired by a recent industrial collaboration, one potential project \
is to use machine learning to accelerate the development of high-temperature \
RNA thermoswitches. RNA thermoswitches are RNA sequences that can control \
expression - for example, by only becoming active once a certain temperature \
has been reached - often via temperature-dependent structural changes . \
Naturally occurring thermoswitches are optimised for temperatures around 37\
\[CapitalAHat]\[Degree]C and often show undesired basal ('leaky') gene \
expression at lower temperatures. Owing to their customisable length and base \
compositions, the ability to design synthetic RNA thermoswitches responsive \
to higher temperatures (>60\[CapitalAHat]\[Degree]C) with reduced leakiness \
at lower temperatures has significant industrial applications. This project \
aims to computationally design and evaluate novel RNA thermoswitches \
specifically optimised for use in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, which is \
widely used in industrial biotechnology.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject \
Aims:\\r\\n\\r\\nUtilise bioinformatics software (primarily NUPACK and \
RNAStructure) to design and evaluate RNA thermoswitches.\\r\\nIdentify \
structural and sequence features of known thermoswitches (e.g., FourU, ROSE, \
Hsp17, Listeria\[AHat]\.80\.99s PrfA) that correlate with optimal \
high-temperature performance.\\r\\nGenerate and analyse RNA thermoswitch \
designs predicted to function effectively at specified industrially relevant \
high temperatures.\\r\\nExamine how RNA thermoswitch structures interact with \
essential genetic elements, both upstream (e.g., promoters, untranslated \
regions) and downstream (e.g., ribosome binding sites, coding sequences) and \
design riboswitches that factor in the functions of these additional \
elements.\\r\\nAssess computational predictions to identify designs that \
minimise leakiness while maintaining efficient gene expression at target \
temperatures.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMethodology:\\r\\n\\r\\nUse NUPACK and \
RNAstructure software to predict RNA secondary structures and thermal \
stability at specified high temperatures.\\r\\nGenerate and characterise a \
set of designed RNA sequences, paying particular attention to structural \
interactions around key genetic regulatory elements.\\r\\nPerform preliminary \
validation of select designs using NUPACK\[AHat]\.80\.99s web-based \
prediction tool.\\r\\nAnalyse datasets to identify RNA sequence and structure \
characteristics associated with effective high-temperature thermoswitch \
function.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nExpected Outcome: This project will provide a \
proof-of-concept demonstration of computational design of synthetic RNA \
thermoswitches suitable for industrial use at elevated temperatures. Outcomes \
will include a dataset of RNA sequences predicted to be robust thermoswitches \
tuned to enable expression at different temperatures, along with insights \
into how sequence and structural elements influence thermoswitch performance.\

are periodic disturbances in atmospheric fields such as temperature or \
density. These range from sound waves, with wavelengths measured in metres or \
less, to planetary-scale Rossby waves, with wavelengths measured in thousands \
of kilometres. Intermediate are gravity waves; these have gravity as the \
restoring force, similar to a wave on the surface of the ocean. Waves are an \
important part of the climate system as they transport momentum and energy \
from place to place without bulk motion of the air.\\r\\n\\r\\nWaves occur in \
other planets\[AHat]\.80\.99 atmospheres as well as on Earth. On Mars, the \
motion of the atmosphere is a major unknown in our understanding of that \
planet\[AHat]\.80\.99s climate, because it is difficult to measure remotely. \
Identifying waves can tell us something about how the atmosphere transports \
momentum and energy, linking remote parts of the atmosphere through the \
general circulation. \\r\\n\\r\\nWe can identify waves by studying images of \
clouds taken in visible or ultraviolet wavelengths, filtered using a \
high-pass filter to remove large-scale structures.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Emirates \
Mars Mission (EMM) has been in orbit around Mars since 9 February 2021. Its \
Emirates eXploration Imager (EXI) instrument is a visible / ultraviolet \
camera that is unique among Mars orbiters as it takes regular observation \
sequences that are suitable for tracking clouds and other small-scale \
phenomena like waves.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis project will use EXI images to look for \
waves in Mars\[AHat]\.80\.99 atmosphere. Processed EXI images are publicly \
available from the EMM Science Data Center. As of 3 December 2024, there are \
229 suitable images in 34 sequences between November 2021 and December 2023. \
\\r\\n\\r\\nStudents will identify waves and characterise their wavelengths, \
frequencies, directions, etc. in terms of location, time of day, season, and \
so on. It may be possible to measure the dispersion relation for some waves, \
which is related to the properties of the surrounding \
atmosphere.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis project would suit students interested in image \

function of muscle fibres is critical for advancing our knowledge of motor \
control and neuromuscular coordination. Muscle spindles, specialised sensory \
structures embedded within skeletal muscles, play a vital role in \
proprioception\[AHat]\.80\.94the sense of body position and movement\[AHat]\
\.80\.94by providing continuous feedback to the nervous system about muscle \
stretch and tension. This feedback is essential for maintaining posture, \
coordinating complex movements, and regulating muscle tone. Despite their \
critical role, the detailed cellular organisation and protein distribution \
within muscle spindles remain incompletely understood, particularly in \
comparison to the more abundant extrafusal fibres that generate muscle force.\
\\r\\nThis project aims to deepen our understanding of the spatial \
distribution of proteins within intrafusal fibres of muscle spindles, \
focusing on their proximity to the cell nuclei, and to compare this \
distribution with that of the surrounding extrafusal fibres. Such analysis \
can provide valuable insights into the specialised structure-function \
relationships in muscle spindles, potentially revealing molecular mechanisms \
underlying muscle sensitivity and control.\\r\\nResearch Focus\\r\\nAdvances \
in imaging technologies, particularly fluorescence microscopy, have \
transformed the way we study cellular structures. Fluorescence techniques \
allow precise visualisation of protein distribution within cells, making it \
possible to quantify differences in protein expression across muscle fibre \
types.\\r\\nIn this project, we will work with sets of three complementary \
images of muscle cross-sections, capturing different cellular features:\\r\\n\
\[AHat]\.80\[Cent]\\tBrightfield (light microscopy) image: provides a general \
structural view of the muscle tissue, highlighting the overall arrangement of \
muscle fibres.\\r\\n\[AHat]\.80\[Cent]\\tNuclear stain (blue fluorescence) \
image: shows the distribution and density of cell nuclei within the muscle \
fibres, which helps distinguish intrafusal fibres within spindles from \
surrounding extrafusal fibres.\\r\\n\[AHat]\.80\[Cent]\\tProtein of interest \
(red fluorescence) image: visualises the concentration and spatial \
distribution of a specific protein, providing insights into its potential \
functional role within the muscle spindle.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject \
Objectives\\r\\n\[AHat]\.80\[Cent]\\tProtein localisation analysis: \
characterise the spatial distribution of the protein of interest relative to \
the nuclei within intrafusal and extrafusal \
fibres.\\r\\n\[AHat]\.80\[Cent]\\tQuantitative comparison: measure and \
compare the relative protein concentrations within spindle (intrafusal) and \
non-spindle (extrafusal) fibres.\\r\\n\[AHat]\.80\[Cent]\\tSpatial pattern \
identification: use advanced image processing and statistical methods to \
identify unique spatial patterns in protein distribution that may reflect \
functional specialisations.\\r\\n\[AHat]\.80\[Cent]\\tBiological insight \
generation: interpret the findings in the context of muscle spindle function, \
potentially uncovering molecular features that contribute to muscle \
sensitivity and reflex control.\\r\\n\\r\\nImpact and Relevance\\r\\nThe \

and has greatly impacted the evaluation of football performance \
[1]\[AHat]\.80\.93[5]. Several clubs are using the insights from the analysis \
of data of played games to improve on their performance in future matches. \
Football is a team sport, and the game has 2 teams, with players trying to \
score a goal.  To analyse a match, it is important to understand the dynamics \
of passes, the positioning and the movement of not only the individual \
players but also the whole team. The interest is to find the emergency of \
patterns in the collective dynamics of players that lead to goals. \
\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this master project, we will be analysing tracking data \
provided by the company Statsbomb [6], spanning several decades of tracking \
data for matches happening in several competitions around the world. The \
interest will be to construct a network representation of a team, based on \
the way footballers pass the ball. The players and their average position are \
the nodes of the network, and the amount of passes one player does to another \
in the duration of a game representing how well connected a player is with \
another will be the links of the network.  We hope to find network structures \
that enhances defensive performance, or those that favours wins. We will also \
do exploratory, and time-series based analysis of the matches, for example, \
understanding the properties of the time-series constructed from observing a \
player or a group of players moving in the pitch during the match. The \
analysis will firstly be focussed on an individual game (which contains \
already a very large amount of data), but could also be developed in more \
than 1 game for example when the interest is to compare the playing styles of \
the different schools of football happening in different continents and \
competitions. \\r\\n\\r\\n1. D. Bargiotas, An Analysis of FC Barcelona \

\\n\\r\\nInspired by a recent industrial collaboration, one potential project \
is to use machine learning to accelerate the development of high-temperature \
RNA thermoswitches. RNA thermoswitches are RNA sequences that can control \
expression - for example, by only becoming active once a certain temperature \
has been reached - often via temperature-dependent structural changes . \
Naturally occurring thermoswitches are optimised for temperatures around 37\
\[CapitalAHat]\[Degree]C and often show undesired basal ('leaky') gene \
expression at lower temperatures. Owing to their customisable length and base \
compositions, the ability to design synthetic RNA thermoswitches responsive \
to higher temperatures (>60\[CapitalAHat]\[Degree]C) with reduced leakiness \
at lower temperatures has significant industrial applications. This project \
aims to computationally design and evaluate novel RNA thermoswitches \
specifically optimised for use in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, which is \
widely used in industrial biotechnology.\\r\\n\\r\\nProject \
Aims:\\r\\n\\r\\nUtilise bioinformatics software (primarily NUPACK and \
RNAStructure) to design and evaluate RNA thermoswitches.\\r\\nIdentify \
structural and sequence features of known thermoswitches (e.g., FourU, ROSE, \
Hsp17, Listeria\[AHat]\.80\.99s PrfA) that correlate with optimal \
high-temperature performance.\\r\\nGenerate and analyse RNA thermoswitch \
designs predicted to function effectively at specified industrially relevant \
high temperatures.\\r\\nExamine how RNA thermoswitch structures interact with \
essential genetic elements, both upstream (e.g., promoters, untranslated \
regions) and downstream (e.g., ribosome binding sites, coding sequences) and \
design riboswitches that factor in the functions of these additional \
elements.\\r\\nAssess computational predictions to identify designs that \
minimise leakiness while maintaining efficient gene expression at target \
temperatures.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMethodology:\\r\\n\\r\\nUse NUPACK and \
RNAstructure software to predict RNA secondary structures and thermal \
stability at specified high temperatures.\\r\\nGenerate and characterise a \
set of designed RNA sequences, paying particular attention to structural \

function of muscle fibres is critical for advancing our knowledge of motor \
control and neuromuscular coordination. Muscle spindles, specialised sensory \
structures embedded within skeletal muscles, play a vital role in \
proprioception\[AHat]\.80\.94the sense of body position and movement\[AHat]\
\.80\.94by providing continuous feedback to the nervous system about muscle \
stretch and tension. This feedback is essential for maintaining posture, \
coordinating complex movements, and regulating muscle tone. Despite their \
critical role, the detailed cellular organisation and protein distribution \
within muscle spindles remain incompletely understood, particularly in \
comparison to the more abundant extrafusal fibres that generate muscle force.\
\\r\\nThis project aims to deepen our understanding of the spatial \
distribution of proteins within intrafusal fibres of muscle spindles, \
focusing on their proximity to the cell nuclei, and to compare this \
distribution with that of the surrounding extrafusal fibres. Such analysis \
can provide valuable insights into the specialised structure-function \
relationships in muscle spindles, potentially revealing molecular mechanisms \
underlying muscle sensitivity and control.\\r\\nResearch Focus\\r\\nAdvances \
in imaging technologies, particularly fluorescence microscopy, have \
transformed the way we study cellular structures. Fluorescence techniques \
allow precise visualisation of protein distribution within cells, making it \
possible to quantify differences in protein expression across muscle fibre \

fibres, which helps distinguish intrafusal fibres within spindles from \
surrounding extrafusal fibres.\\r\\n\[AHat]\.80\[Cent]\\tProtein of interest \

patients in hospital is crucial for optimising resource allocation, reducing \
healthcare costs, and improving patient flow. Accurate predictions enable \
hospitals to better manage bed availability, staffing, and treatment plans, \
ultimately enhancing the efficiency and quality of patient care.\\r\\nIn this \
project we will apply a Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach to predict \
the length of stay in hospital of patients. We will use the publicly \
available MIMIC-III dataset, which comprises deidentified health-related data \
associated with over forty thousand patients admitted to the Beth Israel \

project aims at generating a summary text report from the existing tabular \
data for each patient. These summaries will then be converted into numerical \
representations (embeddings) using a language model such as BioBERT. Finally, \
these embeddings will be input into a neural network model trained to predict \
each patient\[AHat]\.80\.99s expected length of hospital stay.\\r\\nThe main \

has greatly impacted the evaluation of football performance \
[1]\[AHat]\.80\.93[5]. Several clubs are using the insights from the analysis \
of data of played games to improve on their performance in future matches. \
Football is a team sport, and the game has 2 teams, with players trying to \
score a goal.  To analyse a match, it is important to understand the dynamics \
of passes, the positioning and the movement of not only the individual \
players but also the whole team. The interest is to find the emergency of \
patterns in the collective dynamics of players that lead to goals. \
\\r\\n\\r\\nIn this master project, we will be analysing tracking data \
provided by the company Statsbomb [6], spanning several decades of tracking \
data for matches happening in several competitions around the world. The \
interest will be to construct a network representation of a team, based on \
the way footballers pass the ball. The players and their average position are \
the nodes of the network, and the amount of passes one player does to another \
in the duration of a game representing how well connected a player is with \
another will be the links of the network.  We hope to find network structures \
that enhances defensive performance, or those that favours wins. We will also \
do exploratory, and time-series based analysis of the matches, for example, \
understanding the properties of the time-series constructed from observing a \
player or a group of players moving in the pitch during the match. The \
analysis will firstly be focussed on an individual game (which contains \
already a very large amount of data), but could also be developed in more \
than 1 game for example when the interest is to compare the playing styles of \
the different schools of football happening in different continents and \
competitions. \\r\\n\\r\\n1. D. Bargiotas, An Analysis of FC Barcelona \
