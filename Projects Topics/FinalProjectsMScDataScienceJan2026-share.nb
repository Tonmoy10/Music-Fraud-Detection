        "In recent years, football analysis has seen rapid growth and has \
greatly impacted the evaluation of football performance \
[1]\[AHat]\.80\.93[5]. Several clubs are using the insights from the analysis \
of data of played games to improve on their performance in future matches. \
Football is a team sport, and the game has 2 teams, with players trying to \
score a goal.  To analyse a match, it is important to understand the dynamics \
of passes, the positioning and the movement of not only the individual \
players but also the whole team. The interest is to find the emergency of \
patterns in the collective dynamics of players that lead to goals. \n\n\n\nIn \
this master project, we will be analysing tracking data provided by the \
company Statsbomb [6], spanning several decades of tracking data for matches \
happening in several competitions around the world. The interest will be to \
construct a network representation of a team, based on the way footballers \
pass the ball. The players and their average position are the nodes of the \
network, and the amount of passes one player does to another in the duration \
of a game representing how well connected a player is with another will be \
the links of the network.  We hope to find network structures that enhances \
defensive performance, or those that favours wins. We will also do \
exploratory, and time-series based analysis of the matches, for example, \
understanding the properties of the time-series constructed from observing a \
player or a group of players moving in the pitch during the match. The \
analysis will firstly be focussed on an individual game (which contains \
already a very large amount of data), but could also be developed in more \
than 1 game for example when the interest is to compare the playing styles of \
the different schools of football happening in different continents and \
competitions. \n\n\n\n1. D. Bargiotas, An Analysis of FC Barcelona Through \

highlighting carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) (including K. \

critical AMR global health threats.\n\nRecent progress in new antibiotic \
development has been dominated by incremental improvements in \
well-established drug classes, such as \[CapitalIHat]\.b2-lactam antibiotics, \
already impacted by resistance. There are few drugs in development that \
target a new mode of action, which is essential for combatting the ongoing \
emergence of bacteria resistant to existing classes of antibiotics. \n\n\
Antimicrobial natural products, compounds discovered in nature, have been \
playing critical roles of human medicines and are critical for the \
development of new therapeutics against multidrug-resistant pathogens. Recent \
discoveries of antibiotics, including repurposed compounds like hygromycin \
A,1 and novel agents such as lolamicin 2 and abaucin,3 suggest that many \
novel antibiotics remain undiscovered.\n\nThe aim of this Master project is \
to construct training dataset for predictive modelling of antimicrobial \
compounds against Gram-negative pathogens. \n\nResearch objectives: \n\n1. To \
construct training dataset from existing natural product inventory.\n\n2. To \
master the use of Chemprop software4 and customize its training dataset for \
predictive modelling of new albopeptide derivatives. This will enable a \
rapid, data-informed approach to identify candidates with enhanced \

data, it is now possible to track a wide range of processes over time. As a \
result, there is an abundance of data in the form of time series\[AHat]\.80\
\.94from epidemiological records (e.g. COVID-19 case counts or mortality \
rates), to physical measurements (e.g. seismic activity), to behavioural data \
(e.g. the motion of insects).\n\n\n\nWhile time series can be visualised \

complex datasets remains a significant challenge. Advanced techniques\[AHat]\
\.80\.94including machine learning methods\[AHat]\.80\.94can automate aspects \
of this analysis, providing faster and deeper insights. Additionally, \
alternative representations of time series, such as networks, can reveal \
structures and properties that may remain hidden in traditional approaches.\n\
\n\n\nThis project will explore modern, data-driven methods for analysing \
time series. Depending on your interests, you may investigate techniques such \
as classification, clustering, or forecasting for time series, or explore \
novel representations like time series networks and their associated metrics.\
\n\n\n\nPotential applications include: analysing the motion and interaction \
of insects, characterising the complexity of physical systems (e.g. material \
fracture or water flow in porous media), or examining epidemiological data to \
better understand disease dynamics or mortality patterns.\n\n\n\nThe specific \
focus of the project will be chosen in consultation at the start, allowing \
students some flexibility based on their interests.\n\n\n\nFurther reading:\n\

specifically, you will:\n\n1.\tDevelop a Multi-Document RAG Pipeline: \
Implement a pipeline capable of processing multiple PDFs from identified \

Guarantee that all extracted summaries and answers are directly traceable and \

electrical activity of the brain, which shows a broad range of complex signal \
behaviours. To understand cortical function, the EEG signal is typically \
divided into bands by frequency (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma), \
isolating the rhythmic activity. These bands are related to different \
physiological functions and produced by different neuronal circuits. However, \
the bands show different characteristics for different cortical locations and \
states of mind, such as during the sleep-wake cycle states, which includes \
the states of wakefulness, rapid-eye movement, and non-rapid-eye movement \
sleep. Since considerable motivation exists for the development of an \
adequate statistical model for spontaneous EEG activity, we propose to study \
the main EEG bands recorded during the sleep-wake state using methods from \
Statistics and Chaos theory. Those taking on this project will be provided \
with an EEG dataset, that they will need to filter into frequency bands \
(pre-processing), obtain the main statistical descriptors for these bands \
(feature extraction), create surrogate signals for statistical hypothesis \
testing (statistical modelling), and analyse the phase portraits created by \
combining some bands (data exploration), which can lead to a state-dependent \
model for the EEG activity during the sleep-wake cycle and improvements to \

        "Background:\n\n\n\nBiotechnology includes the engineering of \
biological elements to develop products that can improve human life and the \
application of machine learning is revolutionizing the field.\n\n\n\nInspired \
by a recent industrial collaboration, one potential project is to use machine \
learning to accelerate the development of high-temperature RNA \
thermoswitches. RNA thermoswitches are RNA sequences that can control \
expression - for example, by only becoming active once a certain temperature \
has been reached - often via temperature-dependent structural changes . \
Naturally occurring thermoswitches are optimised for temperatures around 37\
\[CapitalAHat]\[Degree]C and often show undesired basal ('leaky') gene \
expression at lower temperatures. Owing to their customisable length and base \
compositions, the ability to design synthetic RNA thermoswitches responsive \
to higher temperatures (>60\[CapitalAHat]\[Degree]C) with reduced leakiness \
at lower temperatures has significant industrial applications. This project \
aims to computationally design and evaluate novel RNA thermoswitches \
specifically optimised for use in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, which is \
widely used in industrial biotechnology.\n\n\n\nProject Aims:\n\n\n\nUtilise \
bioinformatics software (primarily NUPACK and RNAStructure) to design and \
evaluate RNA thermoswitches.\n\nIdentify structural and sequence features of \
known thermoswitches (e.g., FourU, ROSE, Hsp17, Listeria\[AHat]\.80\.99s \
PrfA) that correlate with optimal high-temperature performance.\n\nGenerate \
and analyse RNA thermoswitch designs predicted to function effectively at \
specified industrially relevant high temperatures.\n\nExamine how RNA \
thermoswitch structures interact with essential genetic elements, both \
upstream (e.g., promoters, untranslated regions) and downstream (e.g., \
ribosome binding sites, coding sequences) and design riboswitches that factor \
in the functions of these additional elements.\n\nAssess computational \
predictions to identify designs that minimise leakiness while maintaining \
efficient gene expression at target temperatures.\n\n\n\n\n\nMethodology:\n\n\
\n\nUse NUPACK and RNAstructure software to predict RNA secondary structures \
and thermal stability at specified high temperatures.\n\nGenerate and \
characterise a set of designed RNA sequences, paying particular attention to \
structural interactions around key genetic regulatory elements.\n\nPerform \
preliminary validation of select designs using NUPACK\[AHat]\.80\.99s \
web-based prediction tool.\n\nAnalyse datasets to identify RNA sequence and \
structure characteristics associated with effective high-temperature \
thermoswitch function.\n\n\n\n\n\nExpected Outcome: This project will provide \
a proof-of-concept demonstration of computational design of synthetic RNA \
thermoswitches suitable for industrial use at elevated temperatures. Outcomes \
will include a dataset of RNA sequences predicted to be robust thermoswitches \
tuned to enable expression at different temperatures, along with insights \
into how sequence and structural elements influence thermoswitch performance.\

        "There are many different types of atmospheric wave, which are \
periodic disturbances in atmospheric fields such as temperature or density. \
These range from sound waves, with wavelengths measured in metres or less, to \
planetary-scale Rossby waves, with wavelengths measured in thousands of \
kilometres. Intermediate are gravity waves; these have gravity as the \
restoring force, similar to a wave on the surface of the ocean. Waves are an \
important part of the climate system as they transport momentum and energy \
from place to place without bulk motion of the air.\n\n\n\nWaves occur in \
other planets\[AHat]\.80\.99 atmospheres as well as on Earth. On Mars, the \
motion of the atmosphere is a major unknown in our understanding of that \
planet\[AHat]\.80\.99s climate, because it is difficult to measure remotely. \
Identifying waves can tell us something about how the atmosphere transports \
momentum and energy, linking remote parts of the atmosphere through the \
general circulation. \n\n\n\nWe can identify waves by studying images of \
clouds taken in visible or ultraviolet wavelengths, filtered using a \
high-pass filter to remove large-scale structures.\n\n\n\nThe Emirates Mars \
Mission (EMM) has been in orbit around Mars since 9 February 2021. Its \
Emirates eXploration Imager (EXI) instrument is a visible / ultraviolet \
camera that is unique among Mars orbiters as it takes regular observation \
sequences that are suitable for tracking clouds and other small-scale \
phenomena like waves.\n\n\n\nThis project will use EXI images to look for \
waves in Mars\[AHat]\.80\.99 atmosphere. Processed EXI images are publicly \
available from the EMM Science Data Center. As of 3 December 2024, there are \
229 suitable images in 34 sequences between November 2021 and December 2023. \
\n\n\n\nStudents will identify waves and characterise their wavelengths, \
frequencies, directions, etc. in terms of location, time of day, season, and \
so on. It may be possible to measure the dispersion relation for some waves, \
which is related to the properties of the surrounding atmosphere.\n\n\n\nThis \
project would suit students interested in image analysis and spectral \
analysis. A background in physics or mathematics would be quite helpful, but \
is not essential.\n\n", "comments" -> "No"|>, <|

a social enterprise working to change how financial wellbeing support is \
offered to people who are struggling with money. We understand that financial \
stress affects mental, physical and social wellbeing, and can place huge \
pressure on individuals, families and communities.\n\nThis is why we design \
services that are more accessible, reduce barriers, and help people get \
support sooner to prevent finances spiralling out of control.\n\nWe provide \
money advice (omni channel), financial wellbeing workshops, and develop \
ethical, AI tools that support both clients as well as the advisors \
delivering frontline services. \n\n\n\nProject Overview\n\nThis project will \
use data-science methods to explore who is and, crucially, who is not \
accessing money and debt-advice services across Scotland when they need it. \
By analysing public datasets (e.g., the Financial Conduct \
Authority\[AHat]\.80\.99s Financial Lives Survey, the Scottish Index of \
Multiple Deprivation, local-authority crisis-fund data, and Office for \
National Statistics wellbeing datasets), students will model demographic and \
geographic patterns of exclusion - comparing factors such as gender, income, \
housing status and rurality.\n\nFindings will help identify underserved \
groups and inform our approach to designing more accessible and inclusive \

core\n\nchallenges in early development is the lack of publicly available \
fraud-labelled datasets, which limits\n\nexperimentation with anomaly \
detection techniques.\n\nThis 12-week MSc project will focus on generating \
synthetic fraud datasets, designing feature\n\nrepresentations for music \
metadata and behavioural patterns, and prototyping anomaly detection\n\n\
methods (e.g., statistical baselines, clustering, or ML approaches). The \
outputs will directly support the\n\nfeasibility stage of REDFLAG and \
contribute valuable groundwork for our collaborative Interface\n\nresearch \

        "Project Overview\n\nUnderstanding the structure and function of \
muscle fibres is critical for advancing our knowledge of motor control and \
neuromuscular coordination. Muscle spindles, specialised sensory structures \
embedded within skeletal muscles, play a vital role in proprioception\[AHat]\
\.80\.94the sense of body position and movement\[AHat]\.80\.94by providing \
continuous feedback to the nervous system about muscle stretch and tension. \
This feedback is essential for maintaining posture, coordinating complex \
movements, and regulating muscle tone. Despite their critical role, the \
detailed cellular organisation and protein distribution within muscle \
spindles remain incompletely understood, particularly in comparison to the \
more abundant extrafusal fibres that generate muscle force.\n\nThis project \
aims to deepen our understanding of the spatial distribution of proteins \
within intrafusal fibres of muscle spindles, focusing on their proximity to \
the cell nuclei, and to compare this distribution with that of the \
surrounding extrafusal fibres. Such analysis can provide valuable insights \
into the specialised structure-function relationships in muscle spindles, \
potentially revealing molecular mechanisms underlying muscle sensitivity and \
control.\n\nResearch Focus\n\nAdvances in imaging technologies, particularly \
fluorescence microscopy, have transformed the way we study cellular \
structures. Fluorescence techniques allow precise visualisation of protein \
distribution within cells, making it possible to quantify differences in \
protein expression across muscle fibre types.\n\nIn this project, we will \
work with sets of three complementary images of muscle cross-sections, \
capturing different cellular features:\n\n\[AHat]\.80\[Cent]\tBrightfield \
(light microscopy) image: provides a general structural view of the muscle \
tissue, highlighting the overall arrangement of muscle fibres.\n\n\[AHat]\.80\
\[Cent]\tNuclear stain (blue fluorescence) image: shows the distribution and \
density of cell nuclei within the muscle fibres, which helps distinguish \
intrafusal fibres within spindles from surrounding extrafusal fibres.\n\n\
\[AHat]\.80\[Cent]\tProtein of interest (red fluorescence) image: visualises \
the concentration and spatial distribution of a specific protein, providing \
insights into its potential functional role within the muscle spindle.\n\n\n\n\
Project Objectives\n\n\[AHat]\.80\[Cent]\tProtein localisation analysis: \
characterise the spatial distribution of the protein of interest relative to \
the nuclei within intrafusal and extrafusal fibres.\n\n\[AHat]\.80\[Cent]\t\
Quantitative comparison: measure and compare the relative protein \
concentrations within spindle (intrafusal) and non-spindle (extrafusal) \
fibres.\n\n\[AHat]\.80\[Cent]\tSpatial pattern identification: use advanced \
image processing and statistical methods to identify unique spatial patterns \
in protein distribution that may reflect functional specialisations.\n\n\
\[AHat]\.80\[Cent]\tBiological insight generation: interpret the findings in \
the context of muscle spindle function, potentially uncovering molecular \
features that contribute to muscle sensitivity and reflex control.\n\n\n\n\
Impact and Relevance\n\nThe insights gained from this project will enhance \
our understanding of the cellular architecture of muscle spindles, providing \
a foundation for future studies on muscle function, neuromuscular diseases, \
and rehabilitation strategies. \n\n", "comments" -> "No."|>, <|

        "Developing models that predict the length of stay of patients in \
hospital is crucial for optimising resource allocation, reducing healthcare \
costs, and improving patient flow. Accurate predictions enable hospitals to \
better manage bed availability, staffing, and treatment plans, ultimately \
enhancing the efficiency and quality of patient care.\n\nIn this project we \
will apply a Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach to predict the length \
of stay in hospital of patients. We will use the publicly available MIMIC-III \
dataset, which comprises deidentified health-related data associated with \
over forty thousand patients admitted to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical \
Center (Boston, USA) between 2001 and 2012.\n\nThe project aims at generating \
a summary text report from the existing tabular data for each patient. These \
summaries will then be converted into numerical representations (embeddings) \
using a language model such as BioBERT. Finally, these embeddings will be \
input into a neural network model trained to predict each patient\[AHat]\.80\

has greatly impacted the evaluation of football performance \
[1]\[AHat]\.80\.93[5]. Several clubs are using the insights from the analysis \
of data of played games to improve on their performance in future matches. \
Football is a team sport, and the game has 2 teams, with players trying to \
score a goal.  To analyse a match, it is important to understand the dynamics \
of passes, the positioning and the movement of not only the individual \
players but also the whole team. The interest is to find the emergency of \
patterns in the collective dynamics of players that lead to goals. \n\n\n\nIn \
this master project, we will be analysing tracking data provided by the \
company Statsbomb [6], spanning several decades of tracking data for matches \
happening in several competitions around the world. The interest will be to \
construct a network representation of a team, based on the way footballers \
pass the ball. The players and their average position are the nodes of the \
network, and the amount of passes one player does to another in the duration \
of a game representing how well connected a player is with another will be \
the links of the network.  We hope to find network structures that enhances \
defensive performance, or those that favours wins. We will also do \
exploratory, and time-series based analysis of the matches, for example, \
understanding the properties of the time-series constructed from observing a \
player or a group of players moving in the pitch during the match. The \
analysis will firstly be focussed on an individual game (which contains \
already a very large amount of data), but could also be developed in more \
than 1 game for example when the interest is to compare the playing styles of \
the different schools of football happening in different continents and \
competitions. \n \[DescendingEllipsis]",

              "Electroencephalography (EEG) is a method to record the \
spontaneous electrical activity of the brain, which shows a broad range of \
complex signal behaviours. To understand cortical function, the EEG signal is \
typically divided into bands by frequency (delta, theta, alpha, beta, and \
gamma), isolating the rhythmic activity. These bands are related to different \
physiological functions and produced by different neuronal circuits. However, \
the bands show different characteristics for different cortical locations and \
states of mind, such as during the sleep-wake cycle states, which includes \
the states of wakefulness, rapid-eye movement, and non-rapid-eye movement \
sleep. Since considerable motivation exists for the development of an \
adequate statistical model for spontaneous EEG activity, we propose to study \
the main EEG bands recorded during the sleep-wake state using methods from \
Statistics and Chaos theory. Those taking on this project will be provided \
with an EEG dataset, that they will need to filter into frequency bands \
(pre-processing), obtain the main statistical descriptors for these bands \
(feature extraction), create surrogate signals for statistical hypothesis \
testing (statistical modelling), and analyse the phase portraits created by \
combining some bands (data exploration), which can lead to a state-dependent \
model for the EEG activity during the sleep-wake cycle and improvements to \
classification accuracy of machine and deep learning algorithms.",

of muscle fibres is critical for advancing our knowledge of motor control and \
neuromuscular coordination. Muscle spindles, specialised sensory structures \
embedded within skeletal muscles, play a vital role in proprioception\[AHat]\
\.80\.94the sense of body position and movement\[AHat]\.80\.94by providing \
continuous feedback to the nervous system about muscle stretch and tension. \
This feedback is essential for maintaining posture, coordinating complex \
movements, and regulating muscle tone. Despite their critical role, the \
detailed cellular organisation and protein distribution within muscle \
spindles remain incompletely understood, particularly in comparison to the \
more abundant extrafusal fibres that generate muscle force.\n\nThis project \
aims to deepen our understanding of the spatial distribution of proteins \
within intrafusal fibres of muscle spindles, focusing on their proximity to \
the cell nuclei, and to compare this distribution with that of the \
surrounding extrafusal fibres. Such analysis can provide valuable insights \
into the specialised structure-function relationships in muscle spindles, \
potentially revealing molecular mechanisms underlying muscle sensitivity and \
control.\n \[DescendingEllipsis]",

build a small box with a plexiglas window, place a phone playing music (or \
speech) inside, and record the optical receiver output while the measurement \
system (laser + photodiode/receiver) is located at a distance. The main \
